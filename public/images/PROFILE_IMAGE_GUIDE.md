📸 Profile Image Instructions

## 🎯 How to Add Your Profile Image

1. **Replace the image file**: 
   - Place your profile photo in this directory: `frontend/public/images/`
   - Name the file: `image.jpg` (replace the existing one)

2. **Supported formats**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`

3. **Recommended specifications**:
   - **Size**: 300x300 pixels (square format)
   - **Quality**: High resolution for sharp display
   - **Format**: JPG or PNG for best compatibility

4. **After replacing the image**:
   - Run `npm run build` to rebuild the app
   - Or use `quick-deploy.bat` to rebuild and deploy
